# Why Use?
> If you want to get some data from Chart, like: `Music`, `Images` and etc, just run the code and it will unpack everything for you.

# How to Use
> To use it is very simple, you will put the code in your project and then you will import it:
**Example**

```
> To unpack, just inform the path where your .osz file is.
```py
unpack("Bad Apple") # In (Bad Apple) obviously put your .osz file name
```
